      "content": "**Welcome! Let's start with what you already know.**\n\nBefore we explore how your circulatory and respiratory systems work together, let's assess your current understanding.\n\n**Pre-Assessment Questions:**\n\n1. **What do you think happens when you breathe in?**\n   - Where does the air go?\n   - What does your body do with it?\n\n2. **Why does your heart beat faster when you exercise?**\n   - Think about what your muscles need when you run\n\n3. **Can you trace the path of a drop of blood through your body?**\n   - Start from the heart and see how far you can go\n\n4. **What do you know about oxygen?**\n   - Why do we need it?\n   - What happens if we don't get enough?\n\n5. **Real-life connection:**\n   - Have you ever felt your pulse?\n   - What do you think it's measuring?\n\n**Let's Think About This:**\nYour body is like a busy city. The circulatory system is like the transportation network (roads, jeepneys, tricycles), and the respiratory system is like the power plants that provide energy. How do you think these systems work together to keep the \"city\" running smoothly?\n\n**Before We Begin:**\n- Don't worry if you don't know all the answers!\n- This is just to see what you already understand\n- Your answers will help guide our learning journey\n\n**Did You Know?**\nYour heart beats about 100,000 times per day, pumping about 7,500 liters of blood through your body. That's enough to fill more than 40 bathtubs!",
