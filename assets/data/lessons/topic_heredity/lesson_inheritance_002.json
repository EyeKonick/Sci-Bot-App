      "content": "## 🔬 Exploring Non-Mendelian Inheritance\n\nLet's discover the five main types of non-Mendelian inheritance!\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: Incomplete Dominance 🌸\n\n**In incomplete dominance, neither allele is fully dominant.**\n\n### Key Concept:\n\n**The heterozygous individual shows a blended or intermediate trait.**\n\n### Classic Example: Four O'Clock Flowers\n\n**Parents:**\n- Red flower (RR)\n- White flower (WW)\n\n**F1 Offspring:**\n- Pink flower (RW) ← Blended!\n\n**Why Pink?**\n- R allele: Produces some red pigment\n- W allele: Produces no pigment\n- RW result: Intermediate amount = Pink\n\n### Other Examples:\n\n**In Humans:**\n- Hair texture (straight + curly = wavy)\n- Some genetic conditions\n\n**In Animals:**\n- Andalusian chickens (black + white = blue-gray)\n- Shorthorn cattle (red + white = roan)\n\n### 💭 Quick Check:\n\n**What phenotype appears in a heterozygous individual with incomplete dominance?**\n\n- One dominant trait?\n- **A blended trait?** ✓\n\n**Answer:** Correct! Incomplete dominance results in a **blended phenotype**.\n\n**Key Point:** In incomplete dominance, you can tell the genotype by looking at the phenotype:\n- RR = Red\n- RW = Pink ← Can tell it's heterozygous!\n- WW = White\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Codominance 🩸\n\n**In codominance, both alleles are equally expressed.**\n\n### Key Concept:\n\n**Unlike incomplete dominance, both traits show fully—not blended.**\n\n### Classic Example: Blood Type AB\n\n**Alleles:**\n- A allele: Produces A antigens\n- B allele: Produces B antigens\n\n**Blood Type AB (Genotype: AB):**\n- Shows **both** A antigens AND B antigens\n- Not a blend—both fully expressed\n- Neither is dominant or recessive\n\n### Another Example: Roan Cattle\n\n**In some cattle breeds:**\n- Red allele: Red hairs\n- White allele: White hairs\n- Roan: Both red AND white hairs (spotted appearance)\n\n### 💭 Quick Check:\n\n**Is there a recessive allele in codominance?**\n\n- Yes?\n- **No?** ✓\n\n**Answer:** Correct! There is **no recessive allele** in codominance—both are equally expressed.\n\n### Incomplete Dominance vs Codominance:\n\n**Incomplete Dominance:**\n- Alleles blend\n- New intermediate phenotype\n- Example: Red + White = Pink\n\n**Codominance:**\n- Both alleles show separately\n- Both phenotypes visible\n- Example: Red + White = Red and White patches\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: Multiple Alleles 🧬\n\n**Multiple alleles mean that more than two alleles exist for a trait.**\n\n### Key Concept:\n\n**Even though there are three or more alleles in the population, a person only gets TWO—one from each parent.**\n\n### Classic Example: ABO Blood Group System\n\n**Three Alleles Exist:**\n- **A allele** (IA)\n- **B allele** (IB)\n- **O allele** (i)\n\n**Dominance Hierarchy:**\n- A and B are **codominant** to each other\n- A and B are both **dominant** over O\n- O is **recessive**\n\n### Possible Blood Types:\n\n**Type A:**\n- Genotype: AA or AO\n- Phenotype: A antigens\n\n**Type B:**\n- Genotype: BB or BO\n- Phenotype: B antigens\n\n**Type AB:**\n- Genotype: AB\n- Phenotype: Both A and B antigens (codominance)\n\n**Type O:**\n- Genotype: OO\n- Phenotype: No antigens (recessive)\n\n### 💭 Quick Check:\n\n**Which blood type is recessive?**\n\n- A?\n- B?\n- **O?** ✓\n\n**Answer:** Correct! Blood type **O is recessive**.\n\n**Example Crosses:**\n\n**Parents: Type A (AO) × Type B (BO)**\n\nPossible children:\n- AB (Type AB) - 25%\n- AO (Type A) - 25%\n- BO (Type B) - 25%\n- OO (Type O) - 25%\n\n**All four blood types possible from these parents!**\n\n---\n\n## Part 4: Polygenic Traits 🌈\n\n**Some traits are controlled by many genes working together.**\n\n### Key Concept:\n\n**These are called polygenic traits, and they show continuous variation.**\n\n### Characteristics:\n\n- Controlled by **multiple genes**\n- Show a **range** of phenotypes\n- Create a **bell curve** distribution\n- Strongly influenced by **environment**\n\n### Examples of Polygenic Traits:\n\n**Height:**\n- Controlled by 700+ genes!\n- Creates continuous range (very short to very tall)\n- Nutrition also affects expression\n\n**Skin Color:**\n- Controlled by 3-4 main genes (many more involved)\n- Creates gradual range of shades\n- Sun exposure affects expression\n\n**Hair Color:**\n- Multiple genes determine shade\n- From very light to very dark\n- Can change with age\n\n**Eye Color:**\n- At least 16 genes involved\n- Not just \"blue\" or \"brown\"\n- Many shades and variations\n\n**Intelligence:**\n- Hundreds of genes involved\n- Strongly influenced by environment\n- Education, nutrition, experiences matter\n\n### Polygenic Traits in Roxas City:\n\n**Why do people in Roxas City have different skin shades?**\n\n### 💭 Quick Check:\n\n**Why are skin tones varied?**\n\n- Because of one gene?\n- **Because of many genes and environment?** ✓\n\n**Answer:** Correct! Polygenic traits involve **many genes and environmental effects**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- Multiple genes create base color\n- Sun exposure causes darkening\n- Nutrition affects skin health\n- All combine for individual shade\n\n### Visual Pattern:\n\n**Polygenic traits create a bell curve:**\n```\n        *\n       ***\n      *****\n     *******\n    *********\n   ***********\nShort → Average → Tall\n```\n\n**Most people are average, fewer at extremes.**\n\n---\n\n## Part 5: Sex-Linked Traits ♂️♀️\n\n**Some genes are found on the X chromosome.**\n\n### Key Concept:\n\n**These traits are called sex-linked traits, and they are more common in males.**\n\n### Why Males Are Affected More:\n\n**Chromosome Differences:**\n- **Females:** XX (two X chromosomes)\n- **Males:** XY (one X, one Y)\n\n**For X-linked recessive traits:**\n\n**Females (XX):**\n- Need **two** recessive alleles to show trait\n- One normal X can mask defective X\n- Can be **carriers** (Xx)\n\n**Males (XY):**\n- Need only **one** recessive allele\n- No second X to mask it\n- Express trait if they inherit one defective X\n\n### Common Sex-Linked Traits:\n\n**Color Blindness:**\n- Red-green color blindness most common\n- About 8% of males affected\n- Only 0.5% of females affected\n- Males: XcY = color blind\n- Females: XcXc = color blind (rare)\n\n**Hemophilia:**\n- Blood doesn't clot properly\n- Mostly affects males\n- Can be life-threatening\n- Famous in European royal families\n\n**Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy:**\n- Progressive muscle weakness\n- Almost exclusively males\n- Symptoms appear in early childhood\n\n### 💭 Quick Check:\n\n**Which condition is a sex-linked trait?**\n\n- **Hemophilia?** ✓\n- Height?\n- Blood type?\n\n**Answer:** Correct! **Hemophilia** is a sex-linked trait on the X chromosome.\n\n### Inheritance Pattern Example:\n\n**Mother: Carrier (XHXh)**\n**Father: Normal (XHY)**\n\n**Possible Children:**\n- **Daughter:** XHXH (normal) - 25%\n- **Daughter:** XHXh (carrier) - 25%\n- **Son:** XHY (normal) - 25%\n- **Son:** XhY (hemophilia) - 25%\n\n**50% of sons will have hemophilia!**\n**Daughters will be carriers or normal.**\n\n### Why Sex-Linked Traits Matter:\n\n**Understanding helps with:**\n- Genetic counseling\n- Family planning\n- Early diagnosis\n- Treatment planning\n- Research and therapy development\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 Summary: Non-Mendelian Inheritance\n\n**What You've Learned:**\n\n### The Five Patterns:\n\n**1. Incomplete Dominance**\n- Traits blend\n- Example: Pink flowers\n\n**2. Codominance**\n- Both traits show\n- Example: AB blood type\n\n**3. Multiple Alleles**\n- More than two options\n- Example: ABO blood system\n\n**4. Polygenic Traits**\n- Many genes involved\n- Example: Height, skin color\n\n**5. Sex-Linked Traits**\n- On X chromosome\n- Example: Color blindness, hemophilia\n\n### Key Differences from Mendelian:\n\n**Mendel's Laws:**\n- Simple dominant/recessive\n- Two alleles only\n- Clear ratios (3:1, 9:3:3:1)\n\n**Non-Mendelian:**\n- Complex patterns\n- Multiple alleles possible\n- Continuous variation\n- Environment important\n- Sex chromosomes involved\n\n---\n\n**Now let's test your understanding of these complex inheritance patterns!** 📝",
