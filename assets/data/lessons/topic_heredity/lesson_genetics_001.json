Chromosomes are found in the **nucleus** of the cell.\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Human Chromosomes 🧑\n\n**Each human body cell has 46 chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs.**\n\n### Chromosome Organization:\n\n**The 23 Pairs:**\n- 22 pairs = **Autosomes** (body chromosomes)\n- 1 pair = **Sex chromosomes** (X and Y)\n\n**Where They Come From:**\n- 23 chromosomes from **mother** (egg)\n- 23 chromosomes from **father** (sperm)\n- Total: **46 chromosomes** (23 pairs)\n\n### Diploid vs Haploid:\n\n**Diploid (2n):**\n- Contains **two sets** of chromosomes\n- Found in **body cells**\n- Humans: 46 chromosomes\n- Symbol: 2n = 46\n\n**Haploid (n):**\n- Contains **one set** of chromosomes\n- Found in **sex cells** (egg and sperm)\n- Humans: 23 chromosomes\n- Symbol: n = 23\n\n### 💭 Quick Check:\n\n**What do we call cells with two sets of chromosomes?**\n\n- **Diploid?** ✓\n- Haploid?\n\n**Answer:** Correct! These cells are called **diploid**.\n\n**Why sex cells must be haploid:**\n- Egg (23) + Sperm (23) = Zygote (46)\n- Maintains constant chromosome number\n- Prevents doubling each generation\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: DNA Structure and the Genetic Code 🧬\n\n**DNA looks like a twisted ladder, called a double helix.**\n\n### DNA Structure:\n\n**Components:**\n- **Sugar-phosphate backbone** (the sides of the ladder)\n- **Nitrogenous bases** (the rungs of the ladder)\n\n**The Four Bases:**\n\n1. **A – Adenine**\n2. **T – Thymine**\n3. **G – Guanine**\n4. **C – Cytosine**\n\n### Base Pairing Rules:\n\n**Complementary Base Pairs:**\n- **A always pairs with T** (A–T)\n- **G always pairs with C** (G–C)\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n- Ensures accurate DNA copying\n- Allows DNA replication\n- Maintains genetic information\n\n### 💭 Quick Check:\n\n**Which bases pair together?**\n\n- **A–T and G–C?** ✓\n- A–G and T–C?\n\n**Answer:** Correct! **A pairs with T**, and **G pairs with C**.\n\n**Example:**\n```\nOriginal strand: A T G C C T A G\nComplementary:   T A C G G A T C\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 4: Genotype and Phenotype 👤\n\n**Understanding the difference between genetic code and observable traits:**\n\n### Genotype:\n\n**Definition:**\n- The **set of genes** you inherit\n- Your **genetic makeup**\n- The **DNA sequence** you carry\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Cannot be seen directly\n- Determines potential traits\n- Inherited from parents\n- Written with letters (e.g., Tt, AA, bb)\n\n**Examples:**\n- TT (homozygous dominant)\n- Tt (heterozygous)\n- tt (homozygous recessive)\n\n### Phenotype:\n\n**Definition:**\n- What you can **observe**\n- Your **physical traits**\n- The **expression** of genes\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Visible or measurable\n- Result of genotype + environment\n- What others can see\n\n**Examples:**\n- Curly hair\n- Brown eyes\n- Tall height\n- Dimples\n- Skin color\n\n### 💭 Quick Check:\n\n**Which of these is a phenotype?**\n\n- **Curly hair?** ✓\n- DNA sequence?\n\n**Answer:** Correct! **Curly hair** is a phenotype—it's an observable trait.\n\n### The Relationship:\n\n```\nGenotype (genes) + Environment → Phenotype (traits)\n```\n\n**Example:**\n- **Genotype:** Tt (genes for height)\n- **Environment:** Good nutrition\n- **Phenotype:** Tall person\n\n---\n\n## Part 5: Heredity and Environment 🌍\n\n**Genes are important—but the environment matters too.**\n\n### Nature vs Nurture:\n\n**Nature (Heredity):**\n- Genes inherited from parents\n- DNA sequence you're born with\n- Determines potential traits\n\n**Nurture (Environment):**\n- Nutrition and diet\n- Exercise and lifestyle\n- Sun exposure\n- Climate and weather\n- Education and experiences\n\n### Real-World Example:\n\n**Skin Color in Roxas City:**\n\n**Heredity Component:**\n- Genes determine base skin color\n- Inherited from parents\n- Melanin production capacity\n\n**Environment Component:**\n- Sun exposure darkens skin\n- Time spent outdoors\n- Use of sun protection\n- Seasonal changes\n\n**Result:** Many people in Roxas City get darker skin after spending time under the sun.\n\n### 💭 Quick Check:\n\n**Which affects traits like skin color?**\n\n- Heredity only?\n- Environment only?\n- **Both heredity and environment?** ✓\n\n**Answer:** Correct! Traits are influenced by **both heredity and environment**.\n\n### Other Examples:\n\n**Height:**\n- Genes set potential (can be 5'0\" to 6'0\")\n- Nutrition determines if potential is reached\n- Poor nutrition = shorter than genetic potential\n- Good nutrition = reaches genetic potential\n\n**Intelligence:**\n- Genes provide foundation\n- Education and stimulation develop it\n- Both nature and nurture essential\n\n**Athletic Ability:**\n- Genes influence muscle type, body structure\n- Training and practice develop skills\n- Environment shapes performance\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 Key Concepts Summary\n\n**What You've Learned:**\n\n✅ **Chromosomes** are found in the nucleus\n✅ **Humans have 46 chromosomes** (23 pairs)\n✅ **DNA** is a double helix with base pairs A-T and G-C\n✅ **Genes** are segments of DNA that code for traits\n✅ **Genotype** is your genetic makeup\n✅ **Phenotype** is your observable traits\n✅ **Both genes and environment** shape who you are\n\n**The Big Picture:**\n- You inherit 23 chromosomes from each parent\n- These chromosomes contain thousands of genes\n- Your genes determine your potential traits\n- Environment influences how traits are expressed\n- You are unique—no one else has your exact combination!\n\n---\n\n**Now let's test your understanding of genes and chromosomes!** 📝",

This is a common misconception!\n\n---\n\n### Question 2️⃣\n\n**What is the difference between genotype and phenotype?**\n\n*Think: One is hidden, one is visible*\n\n**Answer:**\n- **Genotype** = Your genetic makeup (the genes you have)\n- **Phenotype** = Your observable traits (what you look like)\n\n**Example:**\n- Genotype: Tt (heterozygous for height)\n- Phenotype: Tall (what you can see)\n\n---\n\n### Question 3️⃣\n\n**Why must sex cells be haploid?**\n\n- **Because chromosome number must stay constant?** ✓\n- Because genes disappear?\n\n**Answer:** Correct! Haploid cells ensure the correct chromosome number after fertilization.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- Egg (23 chromosomes) + Sperm (23 chromosomes) = Zygote (46 chromosomes)\n- If sex cells were diploid (46), the zygote would have 92 chromosomes!\n- Haploid sex cells maintain the species' chromosome number\n\n---\n\n### Question 4️⃣\n\n**Where are chromosomes located in most human cells?**\n\n**Answer:** In the nucleus\n\n---\n\n### Question 5️⃣\n\n**How many chromosomes do humans have in body cells?**\n\n**Answer:** 46 chromosomes (23 pairs)\n\n---\n\n### Question 6️⃣\n\n**Which bases pair together in DNA?**\n\n**Answer:**\n- A pairs with T (Adenine–Thymine)\n- G pairs with C (Guanine–Cytosine)\n\n---\n\n### Question 7️⃣\n\n**Give an example of a phenotype.**\n\n**Possible Answers:**\n- Curly hair\n- Brown eyes\n- Tall height\n- Dimples\n- Skin color\n- Blood type (when expressed)\n\n*(Any observable trait is correct)*\n\n---\n\n### Question 8️⃣\n\n**True or False: Environment can affect how genes are expressed.**\n\n**Answer:** TRUE\n\nGenes provide the blueprint, but environment influences how traits develop.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Nutrition affects height\n- Sun exposure affects skin color\n- Exercise affects muscle development\n\n---\n\n### Question 9️⃣\n\n**What is a gene?**\n\n**Answer:** A segment of DNA that codes for a specific trait or protein.\n\n---\n\n### Question 🔟\n\n**Why do family members look alike?**\n\n**Answer:** Because they inherit genes from the same parents. These shared genes determine similar traits like face shape, eye color, hair texture, etc.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Reflection Questions\n\nThink deeper about genetics:\n\n1. **What traits do you share with your parents? Which ones are different?**\n   - *Consider: Eye color, hair type, height, face shape*\n\n2. **Can identical twins have different traits?**\n   - *Think: What role does environment play?*\n\n3. **Why is genetic diversity important?**\n   - *Consider: Adaptation, evolution, health*\n\n4. **How might understanding genetics help in medicine?**\n   - *Think: Disease prediction, treatment, prevention*\n\n---\n\n**If you can answer most of these questions, you're mastering genetics!** 🌟\n\nRemember: Your genes make you unique, but you're more than just your DNA! 💪",
