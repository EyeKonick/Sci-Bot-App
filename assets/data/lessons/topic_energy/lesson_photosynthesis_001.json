Thylakoids:**\n- Disc-shaped membrane structures\n- Where **light-dependent reactions** occur\n- Contain chlorophyll\n- Site of light capture\n\n**2. Grana (plural of Granum):**\n- **Stacks of thylakoids**\n- Looks like stacks of coins\n- Increases surface area\n- More space for chlorophyll\n\n**3. Stroma:**\n- Fluid-filled space around thylakoids\n- Where **light-independent reactions** occur\n- Contains enzymes for Calvin cycle\n- Site of glucose production\n\n**4. Chlorophyll:**\n- **Green pigment** that traps sunlight\n- Located in thylakoid membranes\n- Absorbs light energy\n- Essential for photosynthesis\n\n### 💭 Quick Check:\n\n**Where do light-dependent reactions occur?**\n\n- Stroma?\n- **Thylakoid?** ✓\n\n**Answer:** Correct! Light-dependent reactions occur in the **thylakoids**.\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: Two Stages of Photosynthesis ⚡\n\n**Photosynthesis has two main stages:**\n\n### Stage 1: Light-Dependent Reactions (Light Reactions)\n\n**Location:** Thylakoid membranes\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Sunlight ☀️\n- Water (H₂O)\n- Chlorophyll\n\n**What Happens:**\n1. Chlorophyll absorbs light energy\n2. Light energy splits water molecules\n3. Oxygen released (from water)\n4. Energy captured in ATP and NADPH\n\n**Products:**\n- **ATP** (energy molecule)\n- **NADPH** (electron carrier)\n- **Oxygen** (O₂) - released to atmosphere\n\n**Summary:** Light energy → Chemical energy (ATP & NADPH)\n\n---\n\n### Stage 2: Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin-Benson Cycle)\n\n**Also called:** Calvin Cycle or Dark Reactions\n\n**Location:** Stroma\n\n**Requirements:**\n- ATP (from light reactions)\n- NADPH (from light reactions)\n- Carbon dioxide (CO₂)\n\n**What Happens:**\n1. CO₂ enters through stomata\n2. Enzymes use ATP and NADPH\n3. Carbon atoms arranged into glucose\n4. Cycle repeats\n\n**Products:**\n- **Glucose** (C₆H₁₂O₆) - food/energy storage\n\n**Note:** Called \"dark\" reactions because they don't directly need light, but they still happen during the day!\n\n### 💭 Quick Check:\n\n**Which stage produces glucose?**\n\n- Light-dependent reactions?\n- **Light-independent reactions?** ✓\n\n**Answer:** Correct! **Glucose is produced in the light-independent reactions** (Calvin Cycle).\n\n---\n\n## Part 4: Light and Pigments 🌈\n\n**Understanding why leaves are green:**\n\n### Light as Energy:\n\n**Light is a form of electromagnetic energy.**\n\n**Visible Light Spectrum:**\n- Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet (ROYGBIV)\n- Different wavelengths\n- Different energy levels\n\n### Chlorophyll and Light:\n\n**Chlorophyll:**\n- **Absorbs** red and blue/violet light\n- **Reflects** green light\n- This is why leaves look green!\n\n**What Happens to Different Colors:**\n- Red light → **Absorbed** (used for energy)\n- Blue/Violet → **Absorbed** (used for energy)\n- Green light → **Reflected** (bounces off, we see it)\n\n### 💭 Quick Check:\n\n**Why do leaves appear green?**\n\n- Because they absorb green light?\n- **Because they reflect green light?** ✓\n\n**Answer:** Correct! Leaves appear green because they **reflect green light**.\n\n**If chlorophyll absorbed all colors, leaves would appear black!**\n\n### Other Pigments:\n\n**Carotenoids:**\n- Yellow, orange, red pigments\n- Help capture additional light\n- Visible in autumn when chlorophyll breaks down\n\n**Xanthophylls:**\n- Yellow pigments\n- Protective function\n\n---\n\n## Part 5: Plant Adaptations - C₄ and CAM Plants 🌵\n\n**In hot and dry places, plants may lose too much water.**\n\n### The Problem:\n\n**Regular plants (C₃):**\n- Open stomata during day\n- Let CO₂ in, water escapes\n- Lose lots of water in hot climates\n- Risk of wilting\n\n**Solution:** Special adaptations!\n\n---\n\n### C₄ Plants:\n\n**Examples:**\n- Corn (mais)\n- Sugarcane\n- Sorghum\n\n**Adaptation:**\n- Special leaf anatomy\n- Fix CO₂ more efficiently\n- Reduce water loss\n- Thrive in hot climates\n\n**Advantage:**\n- Can photosynthesize in hot weather\n- Better in tropical regions (like Philippines!)\n- Higher efficiency\n\n---\n\n### CAM Plants (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism):\n\n**Examples:**\n- Cactus\n- Pineapple (pinya!)\n- Agave\n- Many succulents\n\n**Special Adaptation:**\n- **Open stomata at NIGHT**\n- Store CO₂ as organic acids\n- Use stored CO₂ during day\n- Stomata closed in daytime\n\n**Advantage:**\n- Minimal water loss\n- Survive in very dry environments\n- Perfect for deserts\n\n### 💭 Quick Check:\n\n**Which plants open stomata at night?**\n\n- C₄ plants?\n- **CAM plants?** ✓\n\n**Answer:** Correct! **CAM plants open stomata at night** to conserve water.\n\n---\n\n### Comparison Table:\n\n**C₃ Plants (Regular):**\n- Stomata open: Day\n- Examples: Rice, wheat, trees\n- Climate: Moderate\n- Efficiency: Standard\n\n**C₄ Plants:**\n- Stomata open: Day\n- Examples: Corn, sugarcane\n- Climate: Hot\n- Efficiency: High in hot weather\n\n**CAM Plants:**\n- Stomata open: Night\n- Examples: Cactus, pineapple\n- Climate: Very dry/hot\n- Efficiency: Maximum water conservation\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 The Big Picture: Energy Flow\n\n**Photosynthesis is the gateway of energy into ecosystems:**\n\n1. **Sun** provides energy (light)\n2. **Plants** capture and convert to chemical energy (glucose)\n3. **Animals** eat plants (or plant-eaters)\n4. **Energy** flows through food chain\n5. **All life** depends on this process!\n\n**In Roxas City:**\n- Rice fields → Photosynthesis\n- Rice → Harvest\n- Rice → Your meal\n- Glucose → Energy for your body\n\n**You are powered by sunlight!** (Just indirectly through plants) ☀️🌾🍚\n\n---\n\n**Now let's test your understanding of photosynthesis!** 📝",
