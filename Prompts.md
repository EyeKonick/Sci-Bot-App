Read the POLISHED_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md file I uploaded.

This is the strategic polishing roadmap for the SCI-Bot Flutter application.

Context files you need to know:
- POLISHED_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md - The polishing roadmap (uploaded)
- CURRENT_APP_STATE.md - Current technical state (uploaded)
- Lesson PDFs - Educational content scripts (REFERENCE ONLY, do not modify)
  Location: D:\Program Projects\Flutter\SciBot\sci_bot\context\Lessons documentation

Your task:
1. Read and understand the entire polishing plan
2. Confirm you understand the phasing approach and scope boundaries
3. Ask me which phase we should start with (or confirm we start with Phase 0)
4. Once confirmed, begin implementing that phase following its exact scope

Critical rules:
- Follow the phase scope strictly (IN/OUT boundaries)
- Lesson PDFs are reference only - never modify lesson content
- Do not touch anything outside the current phase scope
- After completing the phase, update the POLISHED_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md file with the completion record as instructed in Section 9
- Do not proceed to the next phase until I confirm current phase is complete

Let's begin. Read the plan and tell me you're ready.

Previouse Phase: 1 completed
Proceed to Next phase: 2

This is the strategic polishing roadmap for the SCI-Bot Flutter application.

Context files you need to know:
- POLISHED_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md - The polishing roadmap (uploaded)
- CURRENT_APP_STATE.md - Current technical state (uploaded)
- Lesson PDFs - Educational content scripts (REFERENCE ONLY, do not modify)
  Location: D:\Program Projects\Flutter\SciBot\sci_bot\context\Lessons documentation

Your task:
1. Read and understand the entire polishing plan
2. Check which phases are already completed (look for "PHASE [N] COMPLETED" records in the plan)
3. Identify the next phase that needs to be implemented
4. Confirm with me: "I see Phase [X] is complete. Should we proceed with Phase [Y]?" (or "No phases completed yet. Should we start with Phase 0?")
5. Once I confirm, begin implementing that phase following its exact scope

Critical rules:
- Follow the phase scope strictly (IN/OUT boundaries)
- Lesson PDFs are reference only - never modify lesson content
- Do not touch anything outside the current phase scope
- After completing the phase, update the POLISHED_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md file with the completion record as instructed in Section 9
- Do not proceed to the next phase until I confirm current phase is complete
- Always check completion records to know where we are in the roadmap

Let's begin. Read the plan, check progress, and tell me which phase we should work on next.
